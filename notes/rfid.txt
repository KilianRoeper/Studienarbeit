-tracking iO/ niO of all stations
iO = 1
niO = 0

-goal: sorting PIs into shelf and live-tracking the position in the process and position in shelf 


Predefining Block Position in Tags to write/read state of station to/from that location:

sending position/time,date of PI in the process at each station

setting: on NFC-Tag
sending: to central PI






assem
-determination of UID to write to NFC-Tag on PI
-setting: iO/niO for the assembling process
	(0xA  &  0xB)

sending: 
{
UID: Id,
current: to shelf,
finished: F,
assembling:{
	state: iO/niO,
	timestamp: time, date
	}
}

if put_into_shelf: 
setting:  iO/niO for shelf (0xC) + position

sending:

	timestamp: time, date,
	in_shelf: T,

-getting shelf-position from robot
-reading states of all stations from predefined locations in NFC-Tab
